# library
In this project, you can add a book to the library by inputting the title, author, number of pages, and whether you've read it or not. Once you add a book in the library, the library will automatically appear on the screen. There will be two buttons for every book entry. One button to remove the book from the library and the other button will change the read status of the book.
